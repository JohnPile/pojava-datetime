Utilities for parsing, representing, calculating, and converting dates and times.

The DateTime object has some pretty decent parsing abilities and is very easy
to use. It parses a wide variety of formats in most languages (for the names
of the months). It is configurable for either Western or European formatting of
dates, such as MM/DD/YYYY vs. DD/MM/YYYY.

DateTime is immutable, making it safer for use with threaded applications. It
also makes it easy to perform Date calculations on the fly.
